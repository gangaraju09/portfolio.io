                        <p class="map-detail">The Central Wisconsin Farmers Market Web App is an online platform designed to provide comprehensive information about farmers markets and Snap stores in the central region of Wisconsin, USA.

                        <p class="map-detail"> ** To access this web map, You should have UW-Madison "MyUW" Login credentials</p>

                            The Central Wisconsin Farmers Market Web App includes several layers that display spatial information related to farmers markets, Snap stores, boundaries, and demographics. These layers can be turned on and off by selecting the eye button, which is a common user interface element used to toggle visibility of elements on a map or in a graphical interface.

                                The information provided indicates the estimated number of people in poverty and the percentage of the population living below the Federal poverty line in the selected area. Specifically, there are an estimated number of people for whom poverty is determined, with estimated to be living below the Federal poverty line.
                            </li>
                            
                            <li class="map-detail">Additionally, the information shows that children under the age of eighteen are estimated to be living in poverty in the area. This suggests that there may be a need for additional resources and support for families with children who are struggling to make ends meet.
                            </li>

                           <li class="map-detail"> Census tract demographic information for the selected region, including the total population as of the 2020 census and poverty information. This information can be useful for understanding the local population and identifying areas where access to healthy food may be limited.</li>

                           <li class="map-detail"> By combining this demographic information with the map of farmers markets and Snap stores, users can identify whether epidemic poverty areas have access to these resources. For example, a user might select an extreme poverty census tract on the map and then turn on the "Farmers Market" and "Snap Stores" layers to see if there are any of these resources nearby.</li>

                           <li class="map-detail"> If there are no farmers markets or Snap stores in the area, this could indicate a gap in access to healthy food options for residents of the community. On the other hand, if there are farmers markets or Snap stores nearby, this could suggest that efforts are being made to address food insecurity in the area.</li>
